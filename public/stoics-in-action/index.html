Someone who knows the frailties of being human but who has continually triumphed over adversity by way of stoicism to live a highly positive and productive life while giving back to others always. This remarkable human being, and WW2 veteran, saw the best of humanity and the worst of humanity and all throughout, he contributed time and time again to increase GOODWILL to ALL those he met within the professional life he led as a Psychotherapist or within his numerous presentations to business, education, and military communities globally. He is a recipient of the highest level of the Legion D’honneur for his services to the French Republic and many other awards for his service to humanity both on and off the battlefield since he left the horrific theatre of war in WW2.</em></p>

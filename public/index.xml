      <description>STOICS IN ACTION  Stoic In Action: Dr Stephen Weiss
Doctor Weiss, who sadly recently passed away, was an educator, an author, a speaker and a unique humanitarian that everyone who met him realized they were in the presence of something quite rare and unique for his remarkable insights into the “human condition”. Someone who knows the frailties of being human but who has continually triumphed over adversity by way of stoicism to live a highly positive and productive life while giving back to others always.</description>
